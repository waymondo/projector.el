`projector` is a lightweight Emacs library for managing project-aware `shell` and `shell-command`
buffers. It leverages either [`projectile`](https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile) or the built-in
`project.el` package to make it easy to manage command line tools.

For async processes, it uses [`alert`](https://github.com/jwiegley/alert) for handling the exit
message. This makes it easy to hook into notification programs like
[`terminal-notifier`](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier) or
[`growlnotify`](http://growl.info/downloads).

## Installation

Recommended install from [MELPA](https://melpa.org) with `M-x package-install projector`.

Example setup:

```elisp
(require 'projector)
(setq alert-default-style 'notifier)
(setq projector-always-background-regex '("^mysql.server\\.*" "^powder\\.*"))
(setq projector-command-modes-alist '(("^heroku run\\.*" . inf-ruby-mode)))
```

## Available Options

###### `projector-project-package`

The project package to be used by Projector. Defaults to `projectile` if the package is available.

###### `projector-always-background-regex`

You can set this to a list of regex patterns for commands that should
always run in the background and will `alert` on completion.

###### `projector-command-modes-alist`

An alist of command patterns to run in specific modes. The alist
should follow the format of `(COMMAND-REGEX . MODE)`.

###### `projector-default-command`

The default command to run with
`projector-run-default-shell-command`. This is usually most helpful to
set on a directoy local level via a
[`.dir-locals.el`](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Directory-Local-Variables.html)
file:

```elisp
((nil . ((projector-default-command . "foreman start"))))
```

## Available Commands

###### `(projector-run-shell-command-project-root)`

Run the named shell command from the current project root in a
dedicated buffer. With the `C-u` prefix, run the process in the
background and output on exit to `alert`.

###### `(projector-run-shell-command-project-root-background)`

Same as running `(projector-run-shell-command-project-root)` with the
`C-u` prefix.

###### `(projector-run-shell-command-current-directory)`

Run the named shell command from the current directory in a dedicated
buffer. With the `C-u` prefix, run the process in the background and
output on exit to `alert`.

###### `(projector-run-shell-command-current-directory-background)`

Same as running `(projector-run-shell-command-current-directory)` with
the `C-u` prefix.

###### `(projector-run-default-shell-command)`

Execute `projector-default-command` at the project root in a dedicated
buffer. With the `C-u` prefix, run the process in the background and
output on exit to `alert`.

###### `(projector-switch-to-or-create-project-shell)`

Find or create a dedicated `shell-mode` buffer for the current
project.

###### `(projector-open-project-shell)`

Use `completing-read` to find or create a `shell-mode` buffer for a
project.

###### `(projector-switch-to-shell-buffer)`

Use `completing-read` to switch to any shell buffer created by `projector`.

###### `(projector-switch-to-shell-buffer-in-project)`

Use `completing-read` to switch to any shell buffer created by
`projector` in the current project.

###### `(projector-switch-project-run-shell-command)`

Switch to another `projectile` project and run a shell command
from that project's root.

###### `(projector-switch-project-run-shell-command-background)`

Switch to another `projectile` project and run a shell command
in the background from that project's root.

###### `(projector-switch-project-run-default-shell-command)`

Switch to another `projectile` project and run the default shell
command from that project's root.

I will leave the key-binding of these up to you, or you can just call
them with `M-x` if you'd prefer.

### Changelog

Nov 12th 2021 - `0.3.3` - added support for modern Emacs `project.el` via
`projector-project-package`. As such, `projectile` is now no longer a hard dependency, and needs to
be installed separately.
